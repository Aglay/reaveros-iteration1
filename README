Reaver Operating System
Version: 0.1 Alpha

ReaverOS is fully object-oriented operating system, written mainly in C++ - and NASM in some places. System API is implemented using interrupt number 80h - the only POSIX thing in entire project, because all of System API - and ever C standard library - is written in C++ (and assembler, of course).
