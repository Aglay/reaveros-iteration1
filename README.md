#Rose, Reaver Project OS

ReaverOS is part of larger - and yet to become actively developed and gather a team - project,
from which it has taken its name - Reaver Project, meant to provide full computer environment.
More about it on [its website](http://reaver-project.org/).

ReaverOS is an attempt to build modern operating system, aimed at x86-64 architecture with
SMP in mind. It is also aiming to be as much legacy free system as possible, while implementing
modern, Âµkernel design.
